This code repository is for the article [Introduction to Streamlit and Streamlit Components](https://auth0.com/blog/introduction-to-streamlit-and-streamlit-components/). The article begins by describing the Streamlit Web application development framework through a series of incremental improvements to simple Python scripts transforming then into fully functional Web apps. It then explains how to develop a customizable Streamlit Component using Python and Next.js/React. The resulting component template will be used in a follow-on article to integrate Auth0 authentication in Streamlit applications.
